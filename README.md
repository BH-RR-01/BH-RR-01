- I'm like... quite profoundly mentally ill. I'm autistic, have dramatic mood swings, PTSD, 2 anxiety disorders and have been battling depression for about 2-3 years now. just be patient with me.
- I can be quite clingy with new people. Because of my BPD, I will hyperfixate on new people and can be quite paranoid if I think I'm not doing everything right. Just a warning.
- I maxxed out my autism on Eddsworld, LittleBigPlanet [y'know that game from the 2000s with the lil brown knitted guy] and drawing. I literally have no room for anything else.

- DNI IF:
- you fall into the average dni criteria. [homophobic, racist, zoophile, etc.]
- you overly ship [for example using the characters real names in ship fanfics, TAGGING THE CREATORS IN SHIP ART] / Actively harass the eddsworld crew. I can not stand anti-fans. [but just to be clear, selfshippers and normal shippers are ok in my book.]
- INT IF:
- Honestly just interact with me if u dont fall into the DNI category, I'd love to make some friends.
